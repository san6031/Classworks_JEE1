1) Abstract classes 
2) Abstract and concrete methods 
3) Interfaces 
4) Difference between Interfaces and Abstract classes 
5) Static and non-static methods 
6) Static and default block 


Authentication tells who you are ? Authorization tells what are you going to do ?


Possible way for authentication are 

User iD password
Voice message 
fingerprint
Retina scan
Mobile Pin
OTP
Face recog...


Abstract classes will have atleast one abstract method
Abstract classes can also have concrete methods ( non abstrcat methods ) 
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated 

If the logics are going to vary with respect to sub classes , then keep the method as abstarct in parent class

If the Logics are NOT going to vary with respect to sub classes , then keep the method as concrete ( non abstract method ) 


// This is not possbile 
class AxisBankServiceProvider extends BankingServiceProvider extends SpecialBankingServideProvider{

Multiple inheritance not permited in this way .


interface IBankServiceProvider {
  A-authenticateUser();
  B-transferMoney();
  C-manageLoan();
  D-rechargeMobile();
  E-bookTickets();
  F-payBills();
}

AxisBankServiceProvider - A,B,D

IndianBankServiceProvider-A,E

CUBBankSericeProvider - all

HDFCBankServiceProvider-A,C,E,F




class AxisBankServiceProvider extends IBankServiceProvider{

}

We need to override all methods even though i need just 3

u must implement all methods even though not used

even though only A B and D are needed


instead of having 6 abstract methods in one interface , we need to have 6 interfaces with each one abstarct method

interface IauthenticateUserServiceProvider{
  public void authenticateUser();
     
}

interface ItransferMoneyServiceProvider{
   public void transferMoney();
      
}

interface IrechargeMobileServiceProvider{
   public void rechargeMobile();
      
}


class GreenBank impements IauthenticateUserServiceProvider{
   public void authenticateUser(){
     sysout ( "Logics ');
   }
}

class USABank implements IauthenticateUserServiceProvider implements  IrechargeMobileServiceProvider{
   public void authenticateUser(){
     sysout ( "Logics ');
   }
  public void rechargeMobile(){
     sysout("Logics");
  }
}


class subclass implement A,implement B,extends C


Conclusion :
   Do not pressurize Abstract classes or interfaces with more methods
   An Interface must have minimum 1 method and maximum 1 method ?



Let us have 15 minutes break 


static and non static methods 

class NumberserviceProvider{
  private int y;
 //setters and getters for y
  static void add(int a,int b){
    print (a+b);
  }
  void sum(int x){
    print (x+y);
  }
}


If the business logic of a method depends on parameters only , we can designate the method as Static 

If the business logic of a method depends on attribute also , we can designate the method as non static


class Car{
   int static numberofwheels=4;
   String color;
   int cost;
}

Car - 3 objects ( maruti , ford , honda ) 

In an interface , By default all the methods are abstract 
In an interface , By default all the variables public ,static and final

a) all static variables can be final - wrong 
b) all final variables can be static - correct 

Static block fired 
Overloded consdtructor is fired - javaprogrammingbook
Overloded consdtructor is fired - dbmsbook
Default constructor is fired - sqlbook

static block fired before constructor 

even if u have n number of objects , only once it is fired 

one time activity opeing log files , authenticating the end user .... will happen in static block

class Trainee{
    traineeid,name,gender,emailid...
  ....
  ...
}


class Batch{
  straing batchCode
  date startddate
  date enddate
  Trainee trainee[]
....
......
...
}
 

class interfacename{
  int pie=3.14;
}
